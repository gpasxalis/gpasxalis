### Beyond the Code 🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
Perseverance – problem-solving's foundation. I have been keen on learning
Computer Science throughout my life and academic journey. Motivated by
determination and guided by the philosophy "if you want it badly, you can get it," I
have developed a keen interest in programming. I have a methodical mind, a step-
by-step mentality, and an insatiable appetite for learning new things. I am excited
about working independently and also as part of a team.
